# <i class="fa fa-id-card" aria-hidden="true"></i>&ensp; About Me
I am a research assistant at [**BGI Research**](https://en.genomics.cn/), utilizing large language models to predict health with human microbiome. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Medicine with a specialization in Preventive Medicine from [**Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), honored to be advised by  [Prof. Qian Jun](https://phs.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/510). Previously, I completed a clinical internship at [**the Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University**](https://www.sysush.com/en). To date, I have published 7 research papers with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jqslgHAAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

<span style="color: purple;">I am now preparing to pursue a PhD, with the intention of enrolling in either the School of Computer Science or the School of Medicine. If your research team has opportunities that align with my background and aspirations, I would be thrilled to discuss. Feel free to contact me!</span>

My research interest includes:
